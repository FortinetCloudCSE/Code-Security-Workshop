## Welcome!

The goal of this workshop is to re-introduce you to the common tenets of code security, introduce some new concepts, and discuss how they are relevant in today's dynamically shifting cloud threat landscape.

## Session 1 (Discussion)
In session 1, we will cover the basics of source code management, best practices, and the concepts of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).

## Session 2 (Lab)

In Session 2, we will cover the basics of hosting cloud-based applications using Amazon Web Service, and some very serious (and sometimes obvious) pitfalls. You will get a web application running on a virtual server in AWS and exposed to the internet. Learn how to create a virtual server, update a security group, create IAM role and deploy a Node web application reachable from the internet. The lab will be available for use beyond the session time. 

## Session 3 (Discussion + Lab)

In session 3, we will discuss code security tools for SAST (Static Application Security Testing), SCA (Software Composition Analysis). You wll use Sonarqube to scan for for problem areas in code and learn about how to address them.

In Lab 2, you will learn how to prevent vulnerable app deployment.

## Session 4 (Discussion + Lab)

Session 4 will cover Infrastructure as Code (IAC) and Terraform fundamentals. 

In lab 3, you will deploy an insecure infrastructure configuration and learn about preventative measures.

## Session 5 (Discussion)

Session 5 will deal with supply chain attacks. Recent newsworthy campaigns, post-mortems, and additional tools.
