## So, how do we fix this?

In the last sections, we looked at SAST and SCA tools and some compelling reasons why they should be a part of the code security strategy for every organization. The labs were intended to be more manual to showcase the underlying mechanics of how these tools work, rather than relying solely on automated pipelines. 

By taking a hands-on approach, you gained insight into the types of issues these tools detect, how to configure them for real-world projects, and how to interpret their output. This manual exploration lays the groundwork for integrating SAST and SCA into CI/CD workflows, enabling more scalable and consistent security practices across teams and projects.

In the following section, we will look at an example of how to automate these processes to streamline remediation efforts.
