#### **Lab 1**

Now, let's talk about the Public cloud. The existence of Cloud providers has been beneficial on so many fronts that we often forget about the dangers that lurk in hiding, waiting for practitioners to slip up so they can take full advantage.  

In **Lab 1**, you will get a web application running on a virtual server in AWS and exposed to the internet.  Learn how to create a virtual server, update a security group, create an IAM role and deploy a Node web application reachable from the internet. What could go wrong?

**CLOUD!** It's so easy, anyone can do it!
